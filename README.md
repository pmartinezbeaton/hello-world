Hi everyone,

This is Pablo, exploring the potential of github for the future.

I love technology that can be used to teach kids and adults new skills that prepare then for the challenges of tomorrow. I am positive that coding and robotics could be a life-change for most of the integrant of the new generation.

I started using the oding project. Thanks
